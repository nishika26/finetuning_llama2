# finetuning_llama2

Llama 2 was finetued with huggingace supervised fine tuning trainer. I used QLoRA(Quantized low-rank adaptation) as a system with GPU isn't available and so this method is the best for when the best you can manage is Google colab's free T4 GPU service. The dataset is also from huggingface and it is in llama's prompt template form.
